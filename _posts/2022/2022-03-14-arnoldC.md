# Introduction
I came across an interesting language while doing a search for my programming language class and thought I should share!
I might make this a series!

# Name
The name of this programming language is.... **ArnoldC**!
 
# What is this?
ArnoldC is an esoteric programming language created by Lauri Hartikka in 2013. The language is created with Scala and the language is made entirely out of one-liners from movies featuring Arnold Schwarzenegge such as Terminator and Total Recall. Parsing is done with Parboiled and ASM is used to generate the Java bytecode.

# Hello World
The language’s “Hello World” program is shown below:

```js
IT`S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "hello world"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
```

# Details on Syntax
Variables and keywords are differentiated by capitalization, in which variables are lowercase and keywords are uppercase. Each new keyword command needs to be written in a new line. There are many methods, and brief explanations are in the wiki page of the language’s github. This language is an imperative programming language.

# Conclusion
This is a programming language not many people know, and it is a very peculiar one!
